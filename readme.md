# Number Guess Game

Number Guess Game is a game built on javascript that allows a user to guess a random number between 1 to 20. It guides users to the correct value, provided audio appraisal, allows users to reset the game and save their highest scores

## Instructions

To play the game, the user should enter a number between 1 -20 inside the input field provided. The system will tell the user whether the number is the correct match of a random number provided between the range. If the guessed value matches the number, then, the game returns a message to congratulate the user as well as an audio appraisal. Thesame happens if the user loses just that he/she is asked to try again in this case.
Again, if the user guessed a number too high or too low, the system will also indicate that. It is built to guide the user to the correct number.
